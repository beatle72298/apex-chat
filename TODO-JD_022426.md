FUNDAMENTALS/WORKFLOW:
- Admin UI will be dockerized as a container that runs on server
- Builds/installers for macOS (.pkg) and Windows (.exe) via github CI/CD on every push
    - Keep in mind firewall rules should be auto-created upon installation

BOTH ADMIN AND CLIENT UI:
~~- Enable URLs sending as links that open in new tab when clicked~~
~~- System dark/light mode detection and setting to override~~
- Custom branding

ADMIN UI:
~~- Need to be able to change settings even when a client/peer is selected. Obviously some settings will take until the server restarts to take effect.~~
~~- Need to be able to deselect or close chat~~
~~- new lines (Enter) do not appear in the chat correctly~~
~~- add ability to enter new line with (Shift+Enter)~~
~~- Timestamps need date in MM/DD/YY format~~
~~- Need to be able to specify/customize the name I am appearing as rather than just being IT~~
~~- Persist chat history, settings, etc. (either SQLite or JSON)~~
- Stylistic: 
~~  - chat area too large/wide~~
~~  - Icons for OS (mac, windows) of client~~
- Text on color profile dropdown (when Dark mode active) hard to read/text too light or background too light
- left align ME sender name inside the bubble
- Sidebar systems features:
    - Searchbar that filters the visible systems in real time
    - Larger icons
    - Add customizable descriptive tags that can be used to filter the host views

CLIENT UI:
~~- Style needs to be more aligned with the chat bubbles in the admin UI~~
~~- Settings window should be accessible from a gear icon like the admin UI~~
~~- Hide the electron default window menu (File, Edit, View, Window, Help)~~
~~- Timestamps need date in MM/DD/YY format~~
~~- Dark/light mode needs to also apply to settings window~~
~~- Settings window still doesn't fit everything~~
~~- Change electron icon in topbar (main client window and settings window) to provided icon.png~~
- Windows - double click icon in tray to open chat window

KNOWN BUGS:
- Sometimes the first message sent by the admin does not appear in the client window. The window pops up properly, but does not display the first message. -- possiby fixed 2/25/26

FUTURE FEATURES:
- Allow for attaching files
~~- See when other user is typing ...~~
~~    - Typing indicator not visible/not functional in the client UI (i.e., if the admin is typing)~~
~~    - Admin UI~~
~~        - Only shows once if client sends more than one back-to-back messages within a short timespan~~
